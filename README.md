# Experimental-Localization
This repo contains contents that are to be  multilingual. 

## Translation content 

A lot of texts, documentation are written in languages which people don't understand. They find it difficult to communicate the problem they are having because they don't understand the native language in which it was implemented.

# CHAOSS Community Handbook

The CHAOSS Community Handbook is a central repository for how we run the project. As part of our value of being transparent, the handbook is open to the world and we welcome feedback. Please make pull requests to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.

If you are interested in helping with the community handbook, [#105](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/issues/105) contains ideas for new sections.
